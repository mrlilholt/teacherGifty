- Include a clear intro + sections + conclusion
- Include at least 10 gift ideas with short teacher-style explanations
- Embed Amazon links as SAFE evergreen Amazon search links (not specific ASINs)
- Every Amazon link must include: ?tag=giftsforteacher-20
- Include 3 internal links to existing posts using relative links like: blog/teacher-gifts-under-20.html
- Output MUST be a FULL standalone HTML file ONLY (no commentary).
- Use simple semantic HTML: h1, h2, p, ul/li, a tags.
