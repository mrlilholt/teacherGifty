You are writing a brand-new MONTHLY REFRESH blog post from a real teacher’s perspective for parents.

Tone:
- Warm, practical, teacher POV
- Positive only
- No hype, no urgency, no “buy now”
- Evergreen language (do not mention years in the body; month is OK in the title only)

Length:
- ~8–12 minute read (roughly 1,200–1,800 words)

Hard output rules (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- Output ONLY HTML that belongs INSIDE <section class="blog-post"> ... </section>.
- Do NOT include: <!doctype>, <html>, <head>, <body>, <header>, <main>, <footer>, or <section>.
- Use only simple semantic HTML: div, h1, h2, p, ul, li, a, strong, em.
- Do not add external JS/CSS. Do not add <link> tags.

Structure requirements:
- Start with:
  <div class="post-meta">Monthly Refresh • Teacher Gift Ideas</div>
  then an <h1> title using the provided title.
- Include a clear intro, multiple sections with <h2>, and a conclusion.
- Include at least 10 gift ideas with short teacher-style explanations.
- Include a <div class="callout"> ... </div> near the bottom with a helpful tip.
- End with:
  <p><a href="../blog.html">← Back to Blog</a></p>

Links requirements:
- Embed Amazon links ONLY as evergreen Amazon SEARCH links (NOT ASIN/product links).
  Example format:
  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=teacher+gift+ideas&tag=giftsforteacher-20
- Every Amazon link MUST include: tag=giftsforteacher-20
- Include 3 internal links to existing posts using relative links like:
  ../blog/teacher-gifts-under-20.html

Return ONLY the inner HTML. No commentary.
